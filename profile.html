<p><ins>What do the results of the tests mean to you?</ins></p>
I have a ‘thinker’ characteristic which means I’m very analytical and introverted, as well as being an auditory learner. The results of the tests
explain in depth the way which I work, learn the best and the environment which I feel most comfortable in, these are results which I need to take
into consideration in order for me to perform my best.

<p><ins>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</ins><p>
By understanding my characteristics and learning style I am able to implement the best way of working in a team for me. This will be much more effective
as It would ensure productivity within group work as well as completing projects at a high standard solely because I practice the results which I have been
provided with. A characteristic I would need to improve on which isn’t presented in my results is communication. Communication is vital in group work so that
is one skill I will need to develop in order to form an ideal team.

<p><ins>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</ins></p>
When forming a team, I need to ensure that I don’t build a team with people who share the same characteristics and learning skills as me.  This is because it will
prevent different thinking and creativity as our learning skills and characteristics lead us to mostly come up with the same solution, leaving minimal room for creativity
and innovation. Also, having a team made up of thinkers and listeners would leave no leaders, communicators and all other characteristics which form an ideal team. So, when
I am forming a team, I need to analyse the results of the candidate’s tests and select people who have their own unique characteristic and learning style when in the team. This will ensure creative thinking, productivity and teamwork.

<br>Hello all, I am a 21 year old kiwi currently living in Melbourne, Australia, <br>
<br>I am from the north side of Melbourne, I moved here to Melbourne from Brisbane a approxiametly four years ago.
I chose to study IT because it is something which I have found interesting and chose to pursue it.

<h1 style="color:Purple;">Interest in IT:</h1>
<p>
<b><ins>Why have you chosen to study this course at RMIT?</ins></b>

<br>I decided to study IT at RMIT because after researching which university would help me do my best and excel in the course "Bachelors of Information Technology"
RMIT came out as the top suggested university to achieve this.</br>

<b><ins>Why am I interested in IT?</ins></b>
I am interested in IT because IT is on the road to being one of the leading occupations. Also, I enjoy the practical work such as creating
programs, websites with code and the problem solving involved in it. I find it very enjoyable and feel like I will excel in it.<br>

<b><ins>Was there a particular event or person which sparked your interest?</ins></b>
A family member of mine pursued an occupation in the IT field and I would always ask him questions about his occupation and he would always reply with
positive, engaging answers. I then looked into it myself and found it to be really interesting.<br>

<b><ins>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</ins></b>
I expect to learn all the main bases of IT fluently so I am able to accurately implement my skills once I pursue a career in cybersecurity (career I want to pursue). I also expect to develop my communication skills as this is essential for any situation.<br>

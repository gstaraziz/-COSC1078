<br>Hello all, I am a 21 year old kiwi currently living in Melbourne, Australia, <br>
<br>I am from the north side of Melbourne, I moved here to Melbourne from Brisbane a approxiametly four years ago.
I chose to study IT because it is something which I have found interesting and chose to pursue it.
I chose RMIT because it was recommended to me and also after looking into the university I decided this is where I'd want to study..<br>

<br>My hobbies include playing sports like Basketball and football, I am a Houston Rockets and Arsenal supporter. I also like
gaming, some games i enjoy are UFC4, Fifa20 and Warzone. Also lastly a hobby I enjoy the most is boxing. I currently box

<br>Why have you chosen to study this course at RMIT?<br>

<br>I decided to study IT at RMIT because after researching which university would help me do my best and excel in the course "Bachelors of Information Technology"
RMIT came out as the top suggested university to achieve this.<br>

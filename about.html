<br>Hello, I am a 21 year old kiwi currently living in Melbourne,Australia, <br>

<br>I am from the north side of Melbourne, moved here from Brisbane a few years back. I chose to study IT because its something
 which I have found interesting and chose to pursue it. I chose RMIT because it was recommended to me and also after looking in
 to the uni I decided this is where I'd want to study..<br>

<br>My hobbies include playing sports like Basketball and football, I am a Houston Rockets and Arsenal supporter. I also like
gaming, some games i enjoy are UFC4, Fifa20 and Warzone. Also lastly a hobby I enjoy the most is boxing. I currently box
at <a href= "https://profitboxing.com"</a> but have not been able to attend due to the pandemic, hopefully all is well soon so
I can get back in the gym. Im always open to try new things because you will never know what you'd like unless you try.<br></p>

<h1 style="color:Black;">Interest in IT:</h1>
<p>
<br>My interest in IT is generally on how it can be implemented in Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management. My interest in IT started around a year ago when a friend of mine advised me on building a desktop instead of just buying another laptop. So, I decided to save some money and build myself a desktop. It was quite
the pleasant experience as I have help from some Youtube videos and friends who guided me and gave me tips and basics on building
a desktop system. On top of that, when I was young, I remember my parents putting me in some beginner computer classes as well. Not only that, during my course I have encountered a few software used in Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management such as </p><ul>
  <li>Warehouse Management System (WMS)</li>
  <li>Electronic Customer Relationship Management (ECRM)</li>
  <li>Transport Management System (TMS)</li>
  <li>Application on cloud computing in the context of Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management</li>
</ul><br>


<br>I choose RMIT because coming from Monash College, I have heard that RMIT offers this specific Logistics and Supply Chain Management course which I have interest in when I was about to finish my Diploma of Business in Monash. In addition, Monash does not offer the course and RMIT school fees is cheaper than Monash. Furthermore, the ranking of RMIT as a university is not bad either, employability after graduation is decent, campus life/facility is to my liking and lastly because I have a few friends who graduated from RMIT recommending me about the overall campus culture and lifestyle.<br>

<br>I expect to learn more about the general fundamentals of IT in general for this course which should be beneficial and fun. Specifically, I would like to learn more about HTML Coding, AI, Robotics, and Cloud Storage as well because those are the items which I think will help me in my future endeavour. Most importantly, in context of IT I would like to learn specifically more about IT Security as I personally think it is the fundamental of the future because for example protecting customers data is very important.<br><p></p>

<h1 style="color:DarkRed;">Ideal Job:</h1>
<p>
<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1930362584/?alternateChannel=search" target="_blank">Delivery Station Manager @Amazon</a><br>

<br><img src="Delivery Station Manager @Amazon 1.jpg">  <img src="Delivery Station Manager @Amazon 2.jpg"> <img src="Delivery Station Manager @Amazon 3.jpg"><br></p><p>
</p><p>
<br>As a Delivery Station Manager in Amazon, I oversee the warehouse facility, ensuring delivery process is as
efficient as it can be. I will also be leading a team of Shift Managers and Shift Assistants. In addition, ensuring a positive working
space and good work relationships on everyday basis. I will also be working along with important business partners such as
</p><ul>
  <li>Transport &amp; Sortation</li> <li>IT</li>
  <li>Flex Finance</li> <li>HR</li>
  <li>Loss Prevention</li> <li>ACES and Engineering</li>
</ul> Furthermore, keeping up with KPI and operational goals.<br>

<br>What make this position appealing to me is that I personally like to work as a 'backbone' of any operations
and being in the transportation/logistic role is what I have been interested in since young because I like
vehicles or anything that moves. Not only that, but working in a company like Amazon will be a dream for me and also having a decent pay.<br>

<br>The skills, qualifications and experience needed for this position is having the experience in the transport
industry, past experience with supervision of staff, fruitful customer service experience, past experience
with rostering and scheduling, good organisation skills and problem solving abilities.<br>

<br>The skills , qualification and experience I currently have is that I used to work in a drum shop, that is
where I have some experience with customer service. And I also used to work as a food delivery driver
which helped me gathered some experience with planning and routing. Lastly, both these jobs have helped me understand how to work under stressful situation.<br>

<br>I plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for that position by graduating from my
Bachelor of Business Majoring in Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management undergraduate degree, followed by
applying to a graduate position in a company, will not be picky about the graduate position as I need to
gather experience.<br><p>

</p><h1 style="color:DarkRed;">Personal Profile:</h1>
<p>
</p><h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Myers-Briggs Test:</h2>

<br>The results I got from the (MBTI) Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test shows that I am <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality/isfp#:~:text=ISFPs%20are%20less%20fantasy%2Doriented%20than%20INFPs.&amp;text=(ISFP%20stands%20for%20Introvert%2C%20Sensing,'%20theories%20of%20personality%20type.)" target="_blank">ISFP</a>, these are Introversion (I),
Senser (S), Feeler (F) and Perceiver (P). Introversion (I) is the highest score with 7, while the lowest score is
Perceiver (P) with a score of just 4. In addition, being ISFP like myself do describe me as someone who likes to be quiet, sensitive, do not force opinions values on others, dislike disagreements and enjoy the present moment and solitary.<br>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Learning Style Test:</h2>

<br>The results show that I am Auditory. Auditory at 45%, Visual at 20% and Tactile at 35%. According to this test I learn effectively by listening and hearing, which generally is quite true. I do find it easier remembering stuff I have heard. It also stated that I gather information by the way it sounds, and more comfortable understanding spoken words than written ones. In addition, also by reading out loud I do manage to absorb it easier because I am able to hear it. Again, what is stated is quite true. <br>
<br><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&amp;A=9&amp;V=4&amp;T=7" target="_blank">My Learning Style Test Result</a><br>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Big Five Personality Test:</h2>

<br>The test shows that I have strong result in all four area <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-big-five-personality-dimensions-2795422#:~:text=The%20five%20broad%20personality%20traits,openness%2C%20conscientiousness%2C%20and%20neuroticism.&amp;text=As%20a%20result%2C%20the%20five,the%20building%20blocks%20of%20personality." target="_blank">(Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness
and Neuroticism)</a>. These score ranges between 2.8 to 3.7 with the highest score belonging to Agreeableness whereas
the lowest score is Extraversion with just only 2.0.<br>

<br>Judging on these results do show some similarity in which that I am quite introverted. Being an introvert myself, I need to be able to calm myself down more, be relax and more comfortable. I also need to be less nervous and start to socialise more often. For me to work better in team, I should be less nervous
and start to be more socialise with colleagues and overcome my own personal social anxiety. I think I can work on my social and
leadership capabilities; improve my communication skills and I also need to feel less unappreciated and undervalued.<br><p>

</p><h1 style="color:DarkRed;">Project Idea:</h1>
<p>
</p><h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Overview:</h2>

<br>This project will be focusing on creating the ideal Transport Management System (TMS) for the current market. In order to achieve this, the system need to optimize the routing system, planning, decision making, transportation cost in the most efficient and effective manner, having clear visibility and transparency for all parties, have accurate logistics key performance indicator (KPI) to measure performance and quicker execution on transportation plan, including customers who is using the system, all parties can pinpoint the exact location of where the shipments are at any given time. This includes full access view from point A to point B, invoicing, booking and customs clearance (Robinson 2015).<br>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Motivation:</h2>

<br>This TMS idea have always been my ideal IT project idea since I started studying Supply Chain Analysis and Design last semester. I find it interesting and useful and decide to delve into it because I personally think there is ways or room for improvement in improving the system and the demand and popularity for a Transport Management System software is always growing. By gathering a team of like-minded people, this project idea should not be too far-fetched and can be achieved if we work together as a team. But however, like almost any project idea, it is not as easy to just create one as having sufficient capital is important.<br>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Description:</h2>

<br>What makes this TMS different from competitors features in terms of product or service is firstly, to emphasis on making it accessible/cheaper cost for Small Medium Enterprise (SME) as most competitors charge premium for software and services like this. The reason why most SME were not keen on using TMS is because of the ‘complexity’ of the system, high barrier to entry/high cost, and maintenance. To entice customers, we must educate and show how not using TMS can be at a great disadvantage. And lastly, customers have the option and able to choose to acquire this by either paying a one-off payment or a subscription service of either monthly, quarterly, or yearly at a reasonable rate (Robinson 2015).<br>

<br>To stand out from other competitors, it is key to make it user-friendly. Process like easy installation, ease of usage, not clunky/faster operation, more practical, and more efficient is also another important factor when it comes to creating the ideal TMS for customers. Furthermore, TMS can also automatically track many shipments, products, and solutions at the same time. It can also establish and consolidate information into something that is easy to read and clear-cut, which able to help with anyone using the system to make quick and clear decisions. With automation, it also reduces human errors significantly. Because of this, all customers can significantly take advantage of this system and ultimately lead to savings in cost and grow its efficiency level as high as possible as the customer can go (Robinson 2015).<br>

<br>Furthermore, this TMS idea will also develop a seamless cloud-based computing in which customers do not need to worry about having big and expensive servers or a dedicated IT team to maintain those system. Customers can open the cloud-bases system from anywhere in the world and utilising this method is less costly for customers maintain, which may again attract more customers, especially SME. For example, customers can pick any freight forwarders or carries that they want from the comfort of their own office. And during this pandemic period, users can work from home simply because of having TMS as mentioned that they can be access from anywhere just with a click of the mouse button (Robinson 2015).<br>

<br>By having a proper TMS that help in choosing the right mode of transport, better routing, and better procurement process, improve customer satisfaction, increase warehouse efficiency, increase delivery capabilities, improve cash flows, reduce inventory and ultimately, all the above-mentioned features lead to savings in cost and increase in Return of Investment (ROI). <br>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Tolls and Technologies:</h2>

<br>In terms of software, hardware or any other equipment needed, firstly, forming the ideal team is important as this will set up the foundation of the software as having motivated and dedicated coders, software engineers, graphic artists, software developer, and more. In terms of hardware, which can be quite costly, is to probably set up a server room, which consist of server racks, computer servers, routers, switches, network cabling and cable management equipment Having a proper airflow in the room, proper cable management, physical security is just a few item to list in order to have a good server room. Probably have left out some other crucial elements but this is all I can think of as for now (Racksolutions 2019).<br>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Skills Required:</h2>

<br>For the skills that I needed for this project, which includes software that is needed to be written, firstly having computer science background and skills will be helpful. Not only that, knowing how to code is also important as well. Since I am coming from a business background, IT is essentially not my strongest point so I probably will hire the relevant people to help set up this software. The part which I can contribute is the logistics and supply chain management aspect of the transport management system which includes setting up vehicle routing and gathering data of carriers and freight forwarders. <br>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;">Outcome:</h2>

<br> If this project is successful, the most likely outcome will be having more companies/businesses switching to our platform. As that is happening, we also need to grow in terms of having more IT support, customer support and business development. And, not to mention that with the increase of success also comes with more work so that means eventually hiring more people for the relevant roles.  The original problem will be the massive barrier to entry as this require having a large sum of capital so to achieve that, having funded by investors will be ideal. Hopefully, the impact that this development has to this world is big as the high accessibility of this system means bringing better efficiency and reduce cost for many SME, companies, and business in the world. Lastly, the impact that will bring to this world is ideally having other competitors to be more competitive in making the best TMS possible as this will set the benchmark for it.  <br>

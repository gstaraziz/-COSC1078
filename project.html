  <h1 style="color:Purple;">Project Idea</h1>
  </center>

<p><b><ins>Overview:</ins></b></p>
The project idea that I have come up with is a mobile app for a weight scale which tracks information about your weight and heart rate. The scale will keep its traditional function
of presenting your current weight, but it will also come with a mobile app which needs to be downloaded from the mobile app store. The app will help you keep track of your weight by
providing you with a daily graph leading on to the following days showing your progression. The app will also provide you with daily averages of your heart rate in case you want to keep track on it.

<p><b><ins>Motivation:</ins></b></p>
This product idea is very useful and helpful because “recording your weight regularly is a powerful motivating tool” (Editors, 2007)  which would empower users to stay consistent
with their fitness and health. Also, “there are more mobile devices in the world than the total number of computers and television units combined, meaning your business needs a mobile
presence to stay connected with its customers” (Sam, 2017), which is why the mobile app is essential. By providing all the users information in the grasp of their hand it makes it much
more convenient and easily accessible for the consumer.

<p><b><ins>Description:</ins></b></p>
The mobile app will be a weight watching application which contains many other advantages such as calorie calculation and a heart rate reader. When the user purchases the scale, they will need
to download the mobile app so information from the scale can be transferred to their account. When the user stands on the scale their current weight as well as their heart rate (BPM) will be presented
on the screen with additional features such as the current time and temperature. The user will then be prompted to stand on the scale another two times for a total of three, so the accuracy of their weight
Is precise. Once they have completed that task the information the scale has gathered will be transferred to the mobile in the form of graphs and data which is easy for the users to read and understand.
The mobile application will present the users current weight and heart rate and as the days progress the information will combine to produce a graph. Another feature the app will come with is calculating
the calories the user has burnt or gained, this will be calculated from the differences in weight gained or lost. The calorie calculations can be used as additional information to further improve the users
weight loss by making changes to their diets and fitness programs to improve calorie loss. To ensure the users do not forget to check their weight daily, the application will come with a notification reminder
telling the user to check their weight so the data collected can stay consistent. Consistency is the only way the mobile app users are able to get the best results, so another feature which the application will
contain is ‘setting goals. The users will have the option to set a weekly, monthly or yearly goal of meeting a certain weight, this way they will be more motivated to continue their journey of bettering their health,
making them maintain consistency. Everyone would love to improve on their health but not everybody has the correct and effective knowledge which they can implement to do so, so the application will have features to help
with that. To further improve on your weight loss the mobile application will come with a “recipe” and “workout” option where a list of recipes for healthy foods and workouts will be displayed. For the “recipe” option, users
will be given the choice to select healthy meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner or the application will recommend a meal for you according to your current weight and how many calories you should lose. For the “workout” option a
list of workouts will be listed for the users to choose from which mainly target burning fat. Both of these additional options are great advantages for the users along with all the other key features this mobile application will contain.
The combination of these features will make the application an ideal application for consumers who are looking to better their health.

<p><b><ins>Tools and Technologies:</ins></b></p>
For the weight scale, innovation is needed in order to collect the data gathered by your scale when you step on it. For that to be possible Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) will need to be added in the scale so the data can sync once connected
to the mobile  (Ray, 2015). The mobile app will be developed with MIT App inventor as this seems the best for me with additional help from an open source tool called “Withings”. This open source tool will help with tracking weight and heart
rates as well as calculating calories and providing the information in graph formats (Liu, 2009).


<p><b><ins>Skills Required:</ins></b></p>
Skills which are required for a successful mobile application is, project management. Communication between the team and the client is necessary in order to develop an application which the user will enjoy using. This can be achieved by
building a strong rapport with the clients (Firenze, 2016). The software that needs to be written will be developed on MIT app inventor which uses a block-based programming language. This can be downloaded from its website, making it easily
accessible. The final hardware I will need to access is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which will make the syncing of data possible. This circuit can be purchased easily from an online website.

<p><b><ins>Outcome:</ins></b></p>
If this project is successful it will change the way people control their weight and maintain a healthy lifestyle. This project idea will empower and motivate people to get their health back on track. The traditional way of checking your weight
just presents you with your weight in kilograms which could be pretty devasting from some people whereas the idea I have developed presents you with a lot more information about yourself and gathers all that information to provide you with possible
solutions and advice to help improve. This project will have a big impact on the health and fitness scene as it provides many resources and sources of empowerment and motivation to achieve that healthy lifestyle everybody is looking for.
